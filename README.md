nanoCAGE bench workflow
=======================

Workflow with check boxes to prepare nanoCAGE libraries in 3 days.  Author:
St√©phane Poulain <stephane.poulain@riken.jp>.

The layout was inspired by the excellent graphical design of the Nanopore
workflows.

A detail procedure has been written as a book chapter... which will be
published when some other chapter authors will have finished their work.
We are as impatient as you are.  Please feel free to contact Charles
Plessy <plessy@riken.jp> in the meantime.
